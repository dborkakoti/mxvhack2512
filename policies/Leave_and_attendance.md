**Leave and Attendance Policy**

**1\. Purpose and Operating Philosophy**

The Leave and Attendance Policy defines the rules governing employee availability, absence, and working discipline. The organization recognizes that while leave is a legitimate entitlement, attendance continuity is critical for business operations, customer engagement, and team coordination-particularly in field sales roles.

This policy seeks to balance employee well-being with operational predictability. Accordingly, leave approvals, usage patterns, and attendance behavior may have downstream implications beyond payroll, including incentives, performance assessment, and disciplinary review.

This policy must be read together with the Sales Incentive Policy, Performance Rating Framework, Territory Reassignment Rules, and Disciplinary and Escalation Policy.

**2\. Scope and Applicability**

This policy applies to:

- All confirmed full-time employees
- All salespersons and sales managers
- Employees operating in field, hybrid, or office-based roles

Probationary employees are governed by simplified rules but may still be subject to attendance-related disciplinary action in cases of gross misuse.

**3\. Definitions**

For the purpose of this policy:

- **Working Day** refers to any calendar day excluding declared company holidays and scheduled weekly offs.
- **Approved Leave** refers to leave sanctioned in advance through approved channels.
- **Unapproved Absence** refers to absence without prior approval or retrospective approval beyond the permitted window.
- **Critical Business Period** refers to periods declared by management, including but not limited to quarter-end, audits, product launches, or key customer engagements.
- **Extended Leave** refers to approved leave exceeding five consecutive working days.

Definitions used here apply only for attendance-related interpretation unless explicitly referenced elsewhere.

**4\. Leave Categories**

**4.1 Casual Leave (CL)**

Employees are entitled to up to **8 days of Casual Leave per calendar year**.

Key rules:

- Intended for short, unforeseen personal requirements
- Generally should not exceed 2 consecutive working days
- Cannot be carried forward or encashed

Casual Leave usage during Critical Business Periods requires explicit managerial approval.

**4.2 Sick Leave (SL)**

Employees are entitled to up to **6 days of Sick Leave per calendar year**.

Rules:

- Sick Leave beyond 2 consecutive days requires medical documentation
- Repeated Sick Leave adjacent to weekends or holidays may be reviewed
- Unused Sick Leave lapses at year-end

Approval of Sick Leave does not automatically exempt performance or incentive impact review.

**4.3 Earned Leave (EL)**

Employees accrue Earned Leave at the rate of **1.5 days per completed month of service**, subject to a maximum accrual of 18 days per year.

Earned Leave:

- May be planned in advance
- May be carried forward as per Section 5
- May be encashed only upon separation, subject to statutory limits

**5\. Carry Forward and Encashment**

Earned Leave may be carried forward up to a maximum of **15 days** at the end of the calendar year.

Any balance beyond 15 days:

- Is forfeited by default
- May be retained only with HR and Functional Head approval

Casual Leave and Sick Leave are not eligible for carry forward or encashment under any circumstances.

**6\. Leave During Critical Business Periods**

During Critical Business Periods:

- Casual Leave requests are discouraged
- Earned Leave exceeding 3 working days requires multi-level approval
- Sick Leave may be subject to post-facto verification

Absence during Critical Business Periods does not automatically constitute misconduct but may:

- Trigger managerial review
- Influence incentive eligibility
- Be considered during performance assessment

**7\. Attendance Expectations for Field Sales**

Field sales roles require consistent market presence.

Accordingly:

- Physical absence from the field without justification may be treated as attendance deviation
- Remote work is not a substitute for field attendance unless explicitly approved
- Lack of field presence during assigned territory days may be reviewed even if leave is approved

**8\. Impact of Leave on Incentives**

Leave usage may impact incentives in the following situations:

- Approved leave exceeding **5 working days in a calendar month** may result in proportional adjustment of incentive eligibility
- Leave coinciding with key sales cycles may influence managerial discretion
- Unapproved absence may result in incentive withholding

Importantly:  
Approved leave does **not automatically disqualify** incentive eligibility, but does **not guarantee protection** either.

**9\. Impact of Leave on Performance Ratings**

Leave patterns may influence performance ratings where:

- Absence materially impacts business outcomes
- Leave usage coincides repeatedly with performance shortfalls
- Approved leave limits the ability to assess performance fairly

Performance downgrades must be justified and documented and are not automatic.

**10\. Unapproved Absence and Late Reporting**

Unapproved absence of even a single working day may trigger:

- Attendance warning
- Review of incentive eligibility
- Entry into performance or disciplinary review

Repeated late reporting (three or more instances in a month) may be treated as attendance violation even if total hours are met.

**11\. Patterns and Abuse**

Patterns of leave usage may be reviewed, including:

- Frequent leave before or after holidays
- Repeated Sick Leave without adequate documentation
- Leave clustering during high-pressure periods

Pattern detection may trigger review even where individual instances were approved.

**12\. Interaction with Territory Reassignment**

Extended absence may result in:

- Temporary territory coverage arrangements
- Permanent territory reassignment in extreme cases

Approved leave alone does not justify permanent reassignment, but prolonged absence combined with business risk may.

**13\. Interaction with Disciplinary Policy**

Attendance-related violations may escalate under the Disciplinary and Escalation Policy where:

- Absence is unapproved
- Misrepresentation occurs
- Instructions are willfully ignored

This policy does not override disciplinary escalation where misconduct is established.

**14\. Managerial Discretion and Exceptions**

Managers may recommend exceptions in genuine cases such as:

- Medical emergencies
- Force majeure events
- Statutory obligations

All exceptions must be:

- Documented
- Time-bound
- Subject to audit

Verbal approvals are discouraged and may not be honored during reviews.

**15\. Documentation and System Records**

Leave and attendance records maintained in official systems shall be treated as final.

Manual corrections require:

- HR approval
- Supporting documentation
- Audit trail

Failure to regularize records does not negate attendance violation.

**16\. Audit and Compliance**

HR reserves the right to audit attendance and leave records at any time.

Audit findings may result in:

- Retroactive adjustments
- Incentive clawbacks
- Disciplinary proceedings

**17\. Conflict Resolution and Policy Precedence**

In case of conflict:

- Disciplinary Policy takes precedence
- Sales Incentive Policy governs payout logic
- Performance Rating Framework governs appraisal logic
- This policy governs leave and attendance interpretation

Where ambiguity persists, the stricter interpretation applies unless formally waived.

**18\. Confidentiality**

Leave and attendance information is confidential and must be handled responsibly.

**19\. Amendments and Clarifications**

HR reserves the right to issue clarifications.

Clarifications do not override this policy unless explicitly stated.

**20\. Effective Date and Supersession**

This policy is effective from **1 January 2024** and supersedes all prior leave and attendance guidelines, informal practices, and email-based clarifications.
