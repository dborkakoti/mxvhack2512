**Disciplinary and Escalation Policy**

**1\. Purpose and Governing Principle**

The purpose of this policy is to define the organization's approach to discipline, escalation, corrective action, and enforcement of standards of conduct. The organization believes that discipline should be corrective rather than punitive, while also ensuring accountability, fairness, and protection of business interests.

This policy establishes the framework for identifying misconduct, assessing severity, escalating issues, and applying consequences. It applies across functions and overrides other policies where explicitly stated.

**2\. Scope and Applicability**

This policy applies to all confirmed employees, including salespersons, managers, and functional heads.

The policy covers:

- Behavioral misconduct
- Performance-related violations (where applicable)
- Compliance breaches
- Data integrity issues
- Repeated policy non-adherence

This policy does not replace statutory disciplinary procedures where applicable but operates in addition to them.

**3\. Definitions**

For the purpose of this policy:

- **Misconduct** refers to any action or omission that violates organizational policies, codes of conduct, or lawful instructions.
- **Escalation** refers to the structured progression of disciplinary response.
- **Corrective Action** refers to actions intended to remedy behavior or performance.
- **Active Disciplinary Action** refers to any ongoing disciplinary process that has not been formally closed.

Ambiguity in classification shall be resolved based on intent, impact, and recurrence.

**4\. Categories of Misconduct**

Misconduct is classified into the following non-exhaustive categories:

**4.1 Minor Misconduct**

Examples include:

- Occasional late reporting
- Isolated failure to follow reporting processes
- Minor procedural deviations

Minor misconduct typically results in informal correction unless repeated.

**4.2 Major Misconduct**

Examples include:

- Repeated attendance violations
- Failure to follow approved territory rules
- Non-compliance with managerial instructions
- Unapproved absence during critical business periods

Major misconduct may result in formal warnings.

**4.3 Gross Misconduct**

Examples include:

- Data falsification or misreporting
- Misrepresentation of sales figures
- Breach of confidentiality
- Willful violation of compliance requirements

Gross misconduct may result in immediate escalation.

**5\. Escalation Levels**

The organization follows a graduated escalation framework.

**Level 1: Informal Correction**

- Verbal discussion
- Documented guidance
- Coaching or retraining

Level 1 does not constitute formal disciplinary action but may be referenced later.

**Level 2: Formal Warning**

- Written warning
- Clear expectations for improvement
- Defined review timeline

Formal warnings are recorded in employee files.

**Level 3: Performance or Conduct Review**

- Structured improvement plan
- Increased monitoring
- Possible role or territory adjustment

This stage may overlap with performance improvement processes.

**Level 4: Severe Disciplinary Action**

- Suspension
- Incentive withholding
- Territory reassignment
- Final warning

**Level 5: Separation Proceedings**

- Termination for cause
- Subject to due process and statutory requirements

**6\. Interaction with Performance Framework**

Disciplinary escalation may be triggered by performance issues when:

- Underperformance is accompanied by non-compliance
- Improvement plans are ignored
- Data integrity concerns arise

However, poor performance alone does not constitute misconduct unless explicitly stated.

**7\. Interaction with Sales Incentives**

Active disciplinary action may impact incentives in the following ways:

- Incentives may be partially or fully withheld
- Overrides approved elsewhere may be revoked
- Clawbacks may be initiated post-review

Incentive withholding during disciplinary review does not imply guilt and may be reversed upon closure.

**8\. Attendance and Leave Violations**

Attendance-related misconduct includes:

- Repeated unapproved absence
- Patterned misuse of leave
- Failure to report absences promptly

Attendance violations may escalate faster during peak business periods.

**9\. Territory and Role Misconduct**

Misconduct related to territory management includes:

- Unauthorized deal booking outside assigned territory
- Failure to hand over responsibilities during reassignment
- Manipulation of attribution timing

Such violations are treated seriously due to revenue impact.

**10\. Data Integrity and Reporting**

The organization places high importance on data integrity.

The following constitute serious violations:

- Manual alteration of system data
- Deliberate delay in reporting to influence outcomes
- Selective disclosure of information

Data integrity violations may be treated as gross misconduct regardless of performance results.

**11\. Investigation Process**

Upon identification of potential misconduct:

- A preliminary review is conducted
- The employee is informed of concerns
- Relevant data and documentation are examined

Employees are expected to cooperate fully.

**12\. Due Process and Representation**

Before imposing severe disciplinary action:

- The employee must be given an opportunity to respond
- Explanations must be documented
- HR must be involved

Failure to respond may be treated as non-cooperation.

**13\. Managerial Authority and Overrides**

Managers may initiate disciplinary action but cannot unilaterally impose severe penalties.

Overrides of standard escalation require:

- HR approval
- Documented justification
- Compliance with statutory norms

Unauthorized penalties may be reversed.

**14\. Duration and Closure of Disciplinary Action**

Disciplinary actions remain active until formally closed.

Closure requires:

- Documentation of resolution
- Communication to the employee
- Update of records

Expired or closed actions must not influence future decisions unless patterns emerge.

**15\. Cumulative Impact**

Repeated minor violations may cumulatively escalate to major misconduct.

Historical patterns may be considered even if individual incidents were resolved.

**16\. Confidentiality**

All disciplinary matters are confidential.

Unauthorized disclosure may itself constitute misconduct.

**17\. Audit and Review**

All disciplinary actions are subject to audit.

Audit findings may result in:

- Reclassification of severity
- Reversal of penalties
- Process changes

**18\. Conflict Resolution and Policy Precedence**

In case of conflict:

- This policy overrides Sales Incentive Policy
- This policy overrides Performance Rating Framework
- This policy overrides Leave and Attendance Policy

Only statutory requirements override this policy.

**19\. Non-Retaliation**

No employee shall be retaliated against for raising concerns in good faith.

False or malicious complaints, however, may attract action.

**20\. Effective Date and Supersession**

This policy is effective from **1 March 2024** and supersedes all prior disciplinary guidelines, circulars, and informal practices.
