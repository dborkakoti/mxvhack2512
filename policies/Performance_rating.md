**Performance Rating Framework**

**1\. Purpose and Design Philosophy**

The Performance Rating Framework defines how individual sales performance is assessed, categorized, and escalated over time. The framework is designed not merely to evaluate outcomes, but to encourage sustained performance improvement, accountability, and behavioral alignment with organizational values.

The organization explicitly recognizes that numeric performance alone is an incomplete indicator. Accordingly, ratings incorporate both quantitative achievement and qualitative judgment, with structured discretion built into the system.

This framework must be read alongside the Sales Incentive Policy, Leave and Attendance Policy, Territory Reassignment Rules, and Disciplinary and Escalation Policy.

**2\. Scope and Applicability**

This framework applies to all confirmed salespersons and sales managers participating in the annual and quarterly performance appraisal cycle.

Probationary employees are assessed under a simplified framework and are excluded from certain escalation provisions unless explicitly stated.

Ratings under this framework may influence:

- Incentive payouts
- Career progression
- Territory assignment
- Eligibility for performance improvement programs
- Disciplinary escalation

**3\. Rating Dimensions**

Performance ratings are determined using a combination of the following dimensions:

**3.1 Quantitative Performance**

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Target achievement percentage
- Consistency across months
- Trend direction (improving, stable, declining)

Quantitative metrics are derived from system-reported data and are subject to audit.

**3.2 Qualitative Performance**

Qualitative assessment includes:

- Customer relationship management
- Compliance with reporting norms
- Collaboration with internal stakeholders
- Adherence to ethical standards

Qualitative inputs are provided by the reporting manager and must be supported with written comments.

**4\. Rating Categories**

Salespersons are classified into one of the following categories:

- **Exceeds Expectations**
- **Meets Expectations**
- **Needs Improvement**
- **Unsatisfactory Performance**

Assignment to a category is based on a holistic assessment and not on any single metric.

**5\. Monthly Performance Tracking vs Formal Rating**

Monthly performance data is tracked continuously but does not automatically translate into a formal performance rating.

Key distinction:

- Monthly data informs trends and early warnings
- Formal ratings are assigned during quarterly or annual reviews

An employee may underperform in a given month without being rated as "Needs Improvement," provided there is evidence of recovery or mitigating circumstances.

**6\. Definition of Underperformance**

For the purpose of escalation:

- **Single-month underperformance** is defined as achievement below 90% of target.
- **Consecutive underperformance** is defined as achievement below 90% for two consecutive months.

However, consecutive underperformance alone does not automatically trigger disciplinary action. Contextual factors must be considered.

**7\. Performance Improvement Window**

When consecutive underperformance is identified, the salesperson enters an **Improvement Window**.

Key characteristics:

- Duration: Two calendar months
- Objectives: Clearly documented performance expectations
- Support: Coaching, training, or territory support as deemed necessary

Successful improvement during this window may result in:

- Reset of performance status
- No further escalation

Failure to improve may trigger escalation under this framework.

**8\. Escalation Triggers and Thresholds**

Escalation may be initiated if:

- Underperformance continues beyond the Improvement Window
- Performance deteriorates further during the Improvement Window
- Behavioral or compliance issues coexist with numeric underperformance

Escalation decisions are not automatic and require managerial review.

**9\. Interaction with Incentives**

Performance ratings may influence incentive outcomes in the following ways:

- "Exceeds Expectations" may strengthen justification for incentive overrides
- "Needs Improvement" may result in partial withholding
- "Unsatisfactory Performance" may result in full withholding, subject to due process

Achievement of numeric targets does not guarantee incentive payout if qualitative performance is rated poorly.

**10\. Managerial Overrides and Discretion**

Managers may override system-suggested ratings in exceptional cases.

Overrides must:

- Be documented
- Include specific reasoning
- Be approved by the next-level manager

Overrides are subject to review and may be reversed during audits.

**11\. Territory and Role Changes**

If a salesperson undergoes territory reassignment during a review period:

- Performance must be assessed separately for each territory where feasible
- Targets may be recalibrated
- Rating normalization may be applied

Territory reassignment does not automatically reset performance history unless explicitly stated.

**12\. Leave, Absence, and Performance Assessment**

Extended approved leave may be considered a mitigating factor.

However:

- Repeated leave during critical periods may be viewed negatively
- Unapproved absences may override quantitative performance

Leave-related considerations must be explicitly documented during reviews.

**13\. Documentation Requirements**

Every performance review must include:

- Quantitative summary
- Qualitative assessment
- Improvement actions (if any)
- Manager comments

Incomplete documentation may invalidate the rating.

**14\. Appeals and Review Mechanism**

Employees may appeal performance ratings within 10 working days of communication.

Appeals must:

- Be submitted in writing
- Clearly state grounds
- Include supporting evidence

HR and the Functional Head jointly provide the final decision.

**15\. Data Integrity and Audit**

All ratings are subject to audit. Manipulation of data, selective reporting, or biased assessments may attract corrective action.

Audit findings may lead to:

- Rating revisions
- Incentive clawbacks
- Disciplinary proceedings

**16\. Interaction with Disciplinary Policy**

Performance escalation may lead to disciplinary review if:

- Improvement plans fail
- Misconduct accompanies underperformance
- Data integrity violations are detected

However, poor performance alone does not constitute misconduct unless explicitly stated.

**17\. Rating Stability and Carryover**

Ratings are not automatically carried forward between periods.

However:

- Past performance trends may influence future assessments
- Repeated cycles of "Needs Improvement" may be treated cumulatively

The absence of formal escalation in prior cycles does not guarantee immunity.

**18\. Confidentiality and Disclosure**

Performance ratings are confidential.

Unauthorized disclosure or comparison with peers may attract disciplinary action.

**19\. Policy Interpretation and Conflict Resolution**

In case of conflict:

- Disciplinary Policy takes precedence
- Sales Incentive Policy governs payout logic
- This framework governs appraisal logic

Where ambiguity exists, management judgment shall prevail.

**20\. Effective Date and Supersession**

This framework is effective from **1 January 2024** and supersedes all previous versions, appraisal circulars, and informal guidance.
