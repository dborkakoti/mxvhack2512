**Sales Incentive Policy**

**1\. Purpose and Intent**

The purpose of this Sales Incentive Policy is to establish a structured, transparent, and performance-linked incentive framework for field sales personnel. The incentive program is designed to drive sustained revenue growth, encourage responsible selling behavior, and align individual performance with organizational objectives.

The policy aims to balance outcome-based rewards with behavioral discipline. While revenue achievement remains the primary driver, the organization explicitly discourages short-term volume chasing that compromises margins, customer relationships, or compliance standards.

This policy must be interpreted in conjunction with the Leave and Attendance Policy, Performance Rating Framework, Territory Reassignment Rules, and Disciplinary and Escalation Policy. Incentive eligibility and payout are subject to compliance with all related policies.

**2\. Scope and Applicability**

This policy applies to all confirmed, full-time salespersons employed in customer-facing sales roles, including but not limited to territory sales executives, key account executives, and regional field sales representatives.

The following categories are excluded unless explicitly stated otherwise:

- Probationary employees
- Contractual or temporary staff
- Trainees or interns
- Employees on long-term deputation outside the Sales function

Incentives under this policy are discretionary in nature and do not form part of fixed compensation.

**3\. Definitions and Key Concepts**

For the purpose of this policy, the following definitions apply:

- **Target**: The monthly revenue objective assigned to a salesperson for a specific territory and product mix.
- **Actuals**: Net revenue realized and booked within the reporting period, after adjustments for returns, cancellations, and approved credit notes.
- **Achievement Percentage**: Actuals divided by Target, expressed as a percentage.
- **Base Incentive**: The standard incentive amount payable at 100% achievement.
- **Reporting Period**: The calendar month for which performance is measured, unless otherwise stated.
- **Incentive Period**: A period over which incentives are reviewed, typically monthly with quarterly consolidation.

Where definitions differ across policies, the definition in this document shall prevail for incentive-related matters unless explicitly overridden.

**4\. Incentive Structure and Achievement Bands**

Incentives are calculated based on monthly target achievement, subject to subsequent review.

**4.1 Achievement Bands**

- Achievement below 90%: No incentive payable.
- Achievement between 90.00% and 99.99%: 50% of Base Incentive.
- Achievement between 100.00% and 109.99%: 100% of Base Incentive.
- Achievement of 110.00% and above: 120% of Base Incentive.

Achievement percentages are rounded down to two decimal places for calculation purposes.

**5\. Monthly Calculation and Quarterly Review**

Incentives are provisionally calculated at the end of each month. However, all monthly payouts are subject to a quarterly review process.

During quarterly review:

- Data corrections may be applied
- Returns and post-facto cancellations may be adjusted
- Audit findings may result in clawbacks
- Exceptional overrides may be normalized

The organization reserves the right to recover excess payouts identified during quarterly or annual audits.

**6\. Deal Attribution and Ownership Rules**

Revenue attribution follows the principle of primary ownership at the time of deal booking.

- Deals are attributed to the salesperson officially assigned to the territory at the time of booking.
- Joint efforts may be split based on documented approval from the Regional Manager.
- Support or shadow involvement does not automatically qualify for incentive sharing.

In case of disputes, the Regional Manager's documented decision shall be final, subject to audit review.

**7\. Territory Changes and Mid-Period Adjustments**

When a salesperson undergoes a territory reassignment during a reporting period:

- Incentives are prorated based on the number of working days spent in each territory.
- Targets may be recalibrated at management discretion.
- Revenue booked before the effective reassignment date is attributed to the original territory.

If reassignment occurs during the last 7 calendar days of a month, management may choose to apply full-month attribution to either territory, based on operational practicality.

**8\. Impact of Leave and Attendance**

Incentive eligibility may be impacted if:

- Approved leave exceeds 5 working days in a reporting month
- Unapproved absence occurs during the reporting period
- Leave coincides with critical business windows

In such cases:

- Incentives may be proportionately reduced
- Eligibility may be deferred
- Managerial review may be triggered

Approved leave does not automatically disqualify incentive eligibility; however, repeated patterns may attract scrutiny.

**9\. Behavioral and Compliance Linkages**

Incentives are contingent upon adherence to organizational policies.

The following may result in partial or full withholding:

- Active disciplinary proceedings
- Proven data misreporting
- Customer complaints involving misconduct
- Non-compliance with reporting standards

Behavioral performance, as defined in the Performance Rating Framework, may influence final incentive payout even if numeric targets are met.

**10\. Overrides, Exceptions, and Discretion**

Regional Heads may approve incentive overrides in exceptional circumstances, such as:

- Force majeure events
- Structural business disruptions
- Systemic data issues

All overrides must:

- Be documented in writing
- Include clear justification
- Be approved prior to payout

Overrides remain subject to internal audit and may be reversed if found unjustified.

**11\. Data Integrity and Audit**

All incentive calculations rely on system-generated data. Manual intervention is discouraged and must be documented.

Internal Audit reserves the right to:

- Review incentive calculations
- Recompute payouts
- Recover excess amounts
- Initiate disciplinary proceedings where applicable

Employees are expected to cooperate fully during audits.

**12\. Dispute Resolution**

In case of disagreement regarding incentive calculation:

- The salesperson must raise a query within 7 working days of payout.
- The Regional Manager reviews the claim.
- HR and Finance provide final determination.

Delayed disputes may not be entertained.

**13\. Confidentiality**

Incentive structures, calculations, and payouts are confidential and should not be disclosed to peers or external parties.

Unauthorized disclosure may be treated as misconduct.

**14\. Policy Interpretation and Precedence**

For incentive-related matters:

- This policy supersedes informal communications.
- This policy takes precedence over the Leave Policy for payout logic.
- Disciplinary Policy overrides this policy in case of conflict.

Where ambiguity exists, management reserves the right to apply the stricter interpretation.

**15\. Effective Date and Supersession**

This policy is effective from **1 April 2024** and supersedes all prior versions, circulars, emails, and verbal instructions relating to sales incentives.
