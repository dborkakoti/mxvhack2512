**Territory Reassignment Rules**

**1\. Purpose and Context**

The purpose of this policy is to define the principles, rules, and procedures governing the reassignment of sales territories. Territory reassignment is a critical operational lever used to respond to business needs, performance issues, market changes, and organizational restructuring.

The organization recognizes that territory changes can materially impact revenue attribution, incentive eligibility, performance ratings, and employee morale. Accordingly, this policy attempts to balance operational flexibility with fairness and predictability.

This policy must be read in conjunction with the Sales Incentive Policy, Performance Rating Framework, Leave and Attendance Policy, and Disciplinary and Escalation Policy.

**2\. Scope and Applicability**

This policy applies to all confirmed salespersons and territory managers operating in field sales roles.

Territory reassignment may occur:

- Within a region
- Across regions
- Temporarily or permanently

This policy does not apply to:

- Short-term deputations under 15 calendar days
- Shadow assignments without formal responsibility transfer
- Temporary coverage during approved leave, unless explicitly documented

**3\. Definitions**

For the purpose of this policy:

- **Territory** refers to a defined geographic, account-based, or distributor-based sales responsibility.
- **Reassignment** refers to the formal transfer of territory ownership from one salesperson to another.
- **Effective Date** refers to the calendar date from which reassignment is considered active.
- **Primary Ownership** refers to the salesperson accountable for performance and reporting in a territory.

Informal handovers or verbal instructions do not constitute reassignment unless ratified in writing.

**4\. Triggers for Territory Reassignment**

Territory reassignment may be initiated due to one or more of the following:

- Business expansion or contraction
- Market realignment
- Prolonged underperformance
- Role change or promotion
- Employee separation or extended absence
- Risk mitigation or customer concentration concerns

The existence of a trigger does not automatically mandate reassignment; managerial judgment applies.

**5\. Authority and Approval**

Territory reassignment must be approved by:

- Regional Head for intra-region changes
- National Sales Head for inter-region changes

HR must be informed for all reassignments exceeding 30 calendar days.

Reassignments without documented approval may be considered invalid for incentive and performance purposes.

**6\. Effective Date and Timing Considerations**

The Effective Date is critical and governs attribution, evaluation, and payout.

Rules:

- Reassignments take effect from the documented Effective Date
- Backdated reassignments are discouraged but may be permitted in exceptional cases
- Reassignments effective within the last 7 calendar days of a month are subject to special handling (see Section 9)

Ambiguity regarding effective dates must be resolved in favor of documented system records.

**7\. Revenue Attribution Principles**

Revenue attribution follows primary ownership as of the booking date.

- Revenue booked before the Effective Date belongs to the original territory owner
- Revenue booked after the Effective Date belongs to the new owner
- Transitional deals may be split if explicitly approved

In the absence of explicit approval, attribution defaults to system ownership.

**8\. Target Recalibration**

Upon reassignment:

- Monthly targets may be recalibrated
- Recalibration is not automatic and requires managerial approval
- Targets may remain unchanged for the transition month

Failure to recalibrate targets does not invalidate reassignment.

**9\. Month-End and Quarter-End Reassignments**

Special rules apply when reassignments occur close to reporting cutoffs.

- Reassignments within the last 7 days of a month may be treated as effective from the next month for incentive purposes
- Quarter-end reassignments may be normalized during quarterly reviews
- Performance data may be split across territories for analytical purposes but not for payout

These adjustments are discretionary and subject to audit.

**10\. Impact on Incentives**

Territory reassignment impacts incentives in the following ways:

- Incentives may be prorated based on days of ownership
- Overrides may be applied to avoid penalizing either party
- Incentive eligibility may be deferred during transition periods

Achievement in reassigned territories does not guarantee incentive payout if performance attribution is unclear.

**11\. Impact on Performance Ratings**

Performance assessment following reassignment must consider:

- Duration of ownership
- Nature of territory inherited
- Historical performance trends

Reassignment does not automatically reset performance history unless explicitly stated.

Repeated reassignments may be viewed as a risk indicator during appraisal.

**12\. Temporary Reassignments and Acting Roles**

Temporary reassignments exceeding 15 calendar days must be documented.

For temporary assignments:

- Performance data may be tracked separately
- Incentive eligibility is determined case-by-case
- Ratings generally continue under the original territory unless otherwise approved

Temporary roles do not guarantee long-term ownership.

**13\. Reassignment Due to Underperformance**

Reassignment due to underperformance may occur after:

- Completion of an Improvement Window
- Failure to meet documented expectations

Such reassignments may:

- Impact future territory eligibility
- Influence performance ratings
- Trigger further review under the Disciplinary Policy

**14\. Interaction with Leave and Absence**

Extended absence may trigger temporary or permanent reassignment.

However:

- Approved leave alone does not constitute grounds for permanent reassignment
- Reassignment during approved leave must be justified and documented

Reassignment during leave may affect incentive and rating calculations.

**15\. Documentation and Communication**

All reassignments must be:

- Documented in writing
- Communicated to affected employees
- Updated in relevant systems

Failure to communicate does not invalidate reassignment but may be considered a process lapse.

**16\. Audit and Review**

All territory reassignments are subject to audit.

Audit findings may result in:

- Attribution correction
- Incentive clawbacks
- Process remediation

Intentional misuse of reassignment to manipulate incentives or ratings may attract disciplinary action.

**17\. Dispute Resolution**

Disputes relating to territory reassignment must be raised within 10 working days of communication.

The Regional Head's decision shall be final, subject to HR and audit review.

**18\. Policy Conflicts and Precedence**

In case of conflict:

- Disciplinary Policy takes precedence
- Sales Incentive Policy governs payout logic
- Performance Rating Framework governs appraisal logic
- This policy governs attribution and ownership logic

Where conflicts persist, management discretion applies.

**19\. Confidentiality**

Territory assignments and reassignments are confidential and should not be discussed externally or with peers beyond business need.

**20\. Effective Date and Supersession**

This policy is effective from **1 February 2024** and supersedes all prior versions, informal practices, and undocumented handover arrangements.
