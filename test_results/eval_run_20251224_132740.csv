2025-12-24T13:26:14.445937,"I took 6 consecutive working days of approved Earned Leave in March, which was quarter-end. My manager says incentives will be reduced. Is this correct?","Partially correct. Approved leave itself does not automatically reduce incentives, but extended leave during a critical period can reduce incentive eligibility if policy-defined productivity thresholds or availability clauses are breached. The reduction must be policy-backed, not discretionary.","I do not have enough information to determine whether your incentives will be reduced due to taking 6 days of approved leave in March. To determine whether this is correct, you should consult the Sales Incentive Policy for details on how leave impacts incentive eligibility. I can search the policy document for you, but I need a more specific query. For example, does the policy mention anything about leave taken during quarter-end?
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer states it doesn't have enough information, and suggests consulting the policy document. It doesn't provide any factual information to compare with the expected answer. Therefore, there are no true positives, false positives, or false negatives. Precision and recall are 0. Accuracy is 0 as the answer does not contain any of the expected information."
2025-12-24T13:26:21.285885,I took Sick Leave but uploaded medical documents a week late. Can this affect incentives or ratings?,"Yes. Delayed documentation can reclassify leave as non-compliant temporarily, which may affect performance assessment and incentive eligibility until regularized. The delay, not the leave itself, is the issue.",Late submission of medical documents may affect incentive and rating calculations. Incomplete documentation may invalidate the rating.,1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer completely captures the essence of the expected answer: a late submission of medical documents affects incentives and ratings. There are no false positives or false negatives. Thus, the answer is accurate, precise, and has perfect recall."
2025-12-24T13:26:28.818075,I was on approved leave during a launch week and another salesperson closed deals in my territory. Who gets credit?,The salesperson who executed and closed the deal gets credit unless there is prior documented deal ownership. Approved leave does not preserve incentive entitlement for work not performed.,"The policy documents state that during approved leave, temporary territory coverage arrangements may be made. Permanent territory reassignment may occur in extreme cases of prolonged absence combined with business risk. Territory reassignment does not automatically reset performance history unless explicitly stated. I do not have information on how sales credits are specifically assigned during temporary territory coverage.
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer does not contain any of the facts from the expected answer. Therefore, there are no true positives. The actual answer discusses territory coverage and reassignment during leave, but it does not address how sales credits are specifically assigned. The expected answer directly addresses sales credit assignment during leave, stating the salesperson who closes the deal gets credit unless there is prior deal ownership and that approved leave does not preserve incentive entitlement for work not performed. Due to the absence of overlap, precision and recall are 0. The answer is not factually correct with respect to the expected answer, thus accuracy is 0."
2025-12-24T13:26:35.657763,A deal was booked before territory reassignment but invoiced after. Who gets credit?,"Credit follows the booking date and territory ownership at the time of deal confirmation, not invoicing, unless policy explicitly defines revenue recognition otherwise.","The policy documents state that territory reassignment impacts incentives, and incentives may be prorated based on days of ownership. For more specific details, please query the policy documents further.
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"Analysis:
Expected Facts: Credit is determined by booking date and territory at the time of deal confirmation.
Actual Facts: Territory reassignment impacts incentives. Incentives may be prorated based on ownership days.

TP: None. There are no overlapping facts between the expected and actual answers.
FP: Territory reassignment impacts incentives. Incentives may be prorated based on ownership days.
FN: Credit is determined by booking date and territory at the time of deal confirmation.

Precision: 0 / (0 + 2) = 0.0
Recall: 0 / (0 + 1) = 0.0
Accuracy: 0. The actual answer doesn't provide the answer to the question, thus it's not factually correct."
2025-12-24T13:26:42.533835,I took approved Casual Leave on three Fridays. Can this still trigger review?,Yes. Even approved leave patterns that indicate potential misuse can trigger a behavioral or attendance review. Approval does not exempt patterns from review.,"Taking approved leave on Fridays can trigger a review if it is repeated during critical periods, impacts performance assessments, influences performance ratings or triggers further review under the Disciplinary Policy. Extended approved leave may be considered a mitigating factor.",1.0,1.0,1.0,The actual answer contains the key information from the expected answer. Taking approved leave can still trigger review if repeated which matches with 'Even approved leave patterns that indicate potential misuse can trigger a behavioral or attendance review'. There are no false positives or false negatives.
2025-12-24T13:26:47.400656,I delayed updating sales data due to travel but corrected it later. Can this be a data integrity issue?,"Yes. Delayed or retroactive data updates can be treated as data integrity risks, especially if they affect reporting timelines or management decisions.","Yes, delaying updating sales data, even if corrected later, can be a data integrity issue. According to company policy, deliberate delay in reporting to influence outcomes is a serious violation. The organization places high importance on data integrity.",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer includes all the information in the expected answer and provides additional context about company policy which reinforces the 'data integrity issue'. There are no false positives or false negatives. Therefore, the precision and recall are both 1.0, and the accuracy is 1.0."
2025-12-24T13:26:52.265520,I received a Level 2 warning but met targets. Can incentives be withheld?,Yes. Active disciplinary actions can override performance outcomes. Incentives are contingent on both results and compliance.,"I am sorry, I am unable to process your request. There seems to be an issue with the query.
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer indicates an inability to process the request, providing no factual information. Therefore, there are no True Positives, False Positives, or False Negatives. This results in a precision and recall of 0.0. Since the answer fails to address the question and provide relevant information, the accuracy is also 0.0."
2025-12-24T13:26:59.125718,Incentives were withheld during a disciplinary review that later closed clean. Can they be reinstated?,Possibly. Reinstatement is allowed if the policy explicitly permits retrospective payout after clearance. It is not automatic and requires formal approval.,"The disciplinary policy takes precedence over the sales incentive policy. I do not have specific information about the reinstatement of incentives after a disciplinary review closes clean. I recommend reviewing the ""Disciplinary Actions"" policy document for details, or consulting with the HR department.",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer does not provide any of the expected information, such as the possibility of reinstatement and the need for policy review and formal approval. Therefore, there are no true positives. The answer states that it doesn't have specific information and recommends consulting other resources, indicating a failure to answer the question based on available knowledge. This leads to zero precision and recall, and consequently, zero accuracy."
2025-12-24T13:27:06.443525,I took 7 days of approved Earned Leave in a month and met targets. Can incentives be reduced?,Yes. Extended leave can proportionally reduce incentive eligibility if minimum active working days or coverage requirements are defined in policy.,"I have retrieved the Sales Incentive Policy. However, based on the policy document, I cannot determine whether incentives can be reduced for taking 7 days of approved Earned Leave in a month, even if targets are met. To determine if your incentives can be reduced, you need to refer to the detailed terms outlined in the Sales Incentive Policy document.
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer fails to provide a definitive answer to the question and states that the information could not be determined from the document, even though the expected answer indicates a reduction may be possible based on policy conditions. Therefore, there are no true positives. All expected facts are missing, and the actual answer doesn't provide any verifiable correct facts derived from the policy. The answer is not factually correct with respect to the expected answer. Therefore, precision, recall and accuracy are zero."
2025-12-24T13:27:13.197930,I worked remotely while on approved leave. Does this count as attendance?,"No. Approved leave remains leave even if work was performed informally. Attendance and incentive eligibility depend on formal status, not ad hoc effort.",Remote work is not a substitute for field attendance unless explicitly approved. Lack of field presence during assigned territory days may be reviewed even if leave is approved. Reassignment during leave may affect incentive and rating calculations and incentives may be proportionately reduced if leave coincides with critical business windows.,0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer does not address the core question of whether working remotely while on leave counts as attendance. The actual answer discusses remote work as a substitute for field attendance and the impact of reassignment during leave on incentives, deviating from the expected answer's focus on leave status and its implications for attendance and eligibility."
2025-12-24T13:27:17.780150,My rating was downgraded due to limited assessability from frequent approved leave. Is this allowed?,Yes. Approved leave does not guarantee full performance assessability. Ratings may reflect insufficient observation periods.,"Leave patterns may influence performance ratings where approved leave limits the ability to assess performance fairly. Performance downgrades must be justified and documented and are not automatic.
",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer contains all the information provided in the expected answer and does not have any hallucinations. Therefore, the answer is completely correct and both precision and recall are 1.0. Because of the complete correctness, the accuracy is also 1.0."
2025-12-24T13:27:22.266882,I informed my manager over WhatsApp about absence but didn’t get approval. Is it unapproved absence?,Yes. Informal communication without system approval does not constitute approved leave and can be treated as unapproved absence.,"According to company policy, absence is unapproved until it has been officially approved.",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer completely captures the core meaning of the expected answer. All facts in the actual answer are present in the expected answer, and all facts in the expected answer are present in the actual answer."
2025-12-24T13:27:28.817670,My territory was reassigned after prolonged approved leave. Is that valid?,"Yes. Prolonged absence can justify temporary or permanent reassignment based on business continuity needs, even if leave was approved.","Territory reassignment does not automatically reset performance history unless explicitly stated. Extended absence may result in temporary territory coverage arrangements or permanent territory reassignment in extreme cases. Approved leave alone does not justify permanent reassignment, but prolonged absence combined with business risk may.",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer provides a nuanced explanation of territory reassignment following prolonged leave, ultimately aligning with the expected answer's core message that prolonged absence, even with approved leave, can justify reassignment due to business needs. All facts in the actual answer are relevant and consistent with the expected information, resulting in a perfect score."
2025-12-24T13:27:33.173675,I met targets but manipulated deal booking timing. Can this be gross misconduct?,Yes. Data manipulation or misrepresentation qualifies as gross misconduct regardless of revenue outcomes.,"Yes, manipulation of attribution timing can be considered a serious violation and may attract disciplinary action.
",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer aligns perfectly with the expected answer. Both answers indicate that manipulating data or attribution timing can be considered a severe violation, constituting gross misconduct."
2025-12-24T13:27:40.112717,I received verbal leave approval during a critical period but didn’t log it. Can this hurt me later?,Yes. Only recorded approvals are enforceable. Verbal approvals without system records expose the salesperson to incentive and disciplinary risk.,"Verbal leave approval without record may lead to issues. The Leave and Attendance Policy states that failure to regularize records does not negate an attendance violation. HR can audit attendance and leave records, and stricter interpretations apply where ambiguity persists unless formally waived. It is advisable to log your leave as soon as possible.
",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer accurately and completely reflects the expected answer. The actual answer provides further context and details supporting the potential risks, which strengthens the answer without introducing inaccuracies. All key facts in the expected answer are present in the actual answer, indicating complete recall and precision."
