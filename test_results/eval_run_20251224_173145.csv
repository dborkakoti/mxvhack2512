Is this correct?","Partially correct. Approved leave itself does not automatically reduce incentives, but extended leave during a critical period can reduce incentive eligibility if policy-defined productivity thresholds or availability clauses are breached. The reduction must be policy-backed, not discretionary.","It depends.

I am unable to retrieve the policy documents currently, please try again later or contact the admin.",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer correctly states that the impact of leave on incentives depends on the specific Sales Incentive Policy, particularly during critical periods like quarter-end.

While the Actual Answer does not explicitly state that leave itself doesn't automatically reduce incentives, its emphasis on the policy clauses implies the same.

2025-12-24T17:30:35.702108,I took Sick Leave but uploaded medical documents a week late. Can this affect incentives or ratings?,"Yes. Delayed documentation can reclassify leave as non-compliant temporarily, which may affect performance assessment and incentive eligibility until regularized. The delay, not the leave itself, is the issue.","Late submission of medical documents can negatively affect your incentives and performance rating. While approval of sick leave doesn't automatically exempt you from a performance or incentive review, unapproved absences may override quantitative performance. Make sure that leave-related considerations are explicitly documented during your review.",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer completely captures the meaning and factual content of the expected answer.

2025-12-24T17:30:39.249937,I was on approved leave during a launch week and another salesperson closed deals in my territory. Who gets credit?,The salesperson who executed and closed the deal gets credit unless there is prior documented deal ownership. Approved leave does not preserve incentive entitlement for work not performed.,"This depends on the specific details outlined in the Sales Incentive Policy and Territory Reassignment policy. First, the Sales Incentive Policy usually specifies how revenue is attributed during leave periods, especially if the leave was approved. Second, the Territory Reassignment policy clarifies the conditions under which a salesperson can close deals in another's territory and how credit is allocated in such cases. I will need to review both policies to give you a definitive answer. Would you like me to do that?
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer does not provide a definitive answer but indicates a need to review the 'Sales Incentive Policy' and 'Territory Reassignment policy'. The expected answer directly states who gets credit. Therefore, there are no true positives. The actual answer introduces policies that are not explicitly mentioned in the expected answer but are relevant to the question, which could be considered false positives in this context. The expected facts about the salesperson closing the deal getting credit and the impact of approved leave are missing from the actual answer, resulting in false negatives. As there are no true positives, precision and recall are 0. The answer does not contain the key facts from the expected answer and therefore accuracy is 0."

Therefore, the salesperson in the original territory would get credit for the deal.",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer correctly and completely answers the question based on the provided policy. It accurately states that credit is given based on the booking date and territory ownership at the time of booking, aligning with the expected answer. There are no false positives or false negatives. Therefore, the precision, recall, and accuracy are all 1.0."
2025-12-24T17:30:49.121117,I took approved Casual Leave on three Fridays. Can this still trigger review?,Yes.

2025-12-24T17:30:59.262710,I received a Level 2 warning but met targets. Can incentives be withheld?,Yes. Active disciplinary actions can override performance outcomes. Incentives are contingent on both results and compliance.,"It depends. Disciplinary policies generally take precedence over Sales Performance Policies. If you have received a Level 2 warning, this could impact your incentive eligibility, even if you have met your targets, based on the disciplinary rules. I am unable to retrieve the exact policy at this time. Please contact the admin and try again later.
",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer conveys the same meaning as the expected answer while providing more context and disclaiming an inability to retrieve the policy. There are no false positives or false negatives, and the answer is entirely correct w.r.t. the expected answer."
2025-12-24T17:31:04.691712,Incentives were withheld during a disciplinary review that later closed clean. Can they be reinstated?,Possibly.

It is not automatic and requires formal approval.,"Please contact the admin, as I am unable to access the company policy documents regarding the reinstatement of incentives after a disciplinary review.
",0.0,0.0,0.0,"The actual answer fails to provide any relevant information from the policy, and instead deflects to contacting the admin. Therefore, there are no true positives. This leads to 0 precision and 0 recall. The answer provides no useful information, therefore, the accuracy is also 0."
2025-12-24T17:31:13.730751,I took 7 days of approved Earned Leave in a month and met targets. Can incentives be reduced?,Yes. Extended leave can proportionally reduce incentive eligibility if minimum active working days or coverage requirements are defined in policy.,"Yes, incentives can be reduced. The policy states that approved leave exceeding 5 working days in a calendar month may impact incentive eligibility.
",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer accurately reflects the information provided in the expected answer and includes a relevant detail (approved leave exceeding 5 days). All key facts are present and correct. Therefore, both precision and recall are 1.0, and accuracy is also 1.0."
2025-12-24T17:31:19.573467,I worked remotely while on approved leave. Does this count as attendance?,"No. Approved leave remains leave even if work was performed informally. Attendance and incentive eligibility depend on formal status, not ad hoc effort.","Working while on approved leave may not count as official attendance. The policy states that remote work is not a substitute for field attendance unless explicitly approved. Additionally, physical absence from the field without justification may be treated as an attendance deviation, even if the leave was approved. Please note that incentive eligibility may be impacted by leave.
",0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,"Expected Facts: Absence from work is considered leave, regardless of whether some work was done informally. Attendance and eligibility are based on formal status, not sporadic effort.

2025-12-24T17:31:26.157243,My rating was downgraded due to limited assessability from frequent approved leave. Is this allowed?,Yes. Approved leave does not guarantee full performance assessability. Ratings may reflect insufficient observation periods.,"Yes, it is allowed. The policy states that approved leave can influence performance ratings, especially where it limits the ability to assess performance fairly or materially impacts business outcomes. Performance downgrades must be justified and documented and are not automatic.
",1.0,1.0,1.0,"The actual answer provides all the information that the expected answer has. In addition, it includes the nuance around justification and documentation that addresses the question in more detail. All the expected facts are contained in the actual answer."
2025-12-24T17:31:28.370195,I informed my manager over WhatsApp about absence but didn’t get approval. Is it unapproved absence?,Yes. Informal communication without system approval does not constitute approved leave and can be treated as unapproved absence.,"Based on company policies, informing your manager over WhatsApp about an absence does not constitute approved leave. The absence would be considered unapproved unless you receive formal approval through the proper channels.
